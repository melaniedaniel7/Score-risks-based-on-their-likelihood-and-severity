# Score risks based on their likelihood and severity

In this activity, I practiced performing a risk assessment by evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly threaten business operations. Then, I decided how to prioritize my resources based on the risk scores I assigned each vulnerability.

Disclosure:

The purpose of having a security plan is to be prepared for risks. Assessing potential risks is one of the first steps of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Risk assessments are how security teams determine whether their security operations are adequately positioned to prevent cyber attacks and protect sensitive information.
