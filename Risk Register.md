Disclaimer:

### Operational environment:
The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's
dataâ€”100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes
2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a
professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial
regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available
each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.

### Notes: How are security events possible considering the risks the asset faces in its operating environment?
Security events are likely to occur from financial records being leaked because the database server of backed up
data is publicly accessible, making it a high risk, and from theft because the bank's safe is left unlocked, also making it a high risk. 
Both of these cases are priority cases.
Security events are less likely to occur from business email compromise, but it is still a risk that an employee is tricked into
sharing confidential information, and is therefore considered a medium level priority. Compromised user database is also at risk and considered a medium level priority because
customer data is poorly encrypted.
Lastly, security events are unlikely to occur from supply chain disruption and this is therefore considered a low level priority. However, this is still a risk factor to consider 
because in the event that a natural disaster happens it would cause delivery delays.
